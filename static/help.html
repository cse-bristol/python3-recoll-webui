    <h1>What's this?</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple search engine for the S-drive.
      It's based on a program called <a href="https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/">recoll</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The search index is updated every day at midnight, so anything from the previous day should come up.</p>
    <p>This also means that the index will contain things that have been deleted until the next day.</p>
    <h1>Search syntax</h1>
    <h2>Searching in files</h2>
    <p>
      If you write text in the box, it looks for documents containing those words, in any order.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you put text in double quotes (<code>&quot;like this&quot;</code>) it looks for documents containing the quoted phrase.
    </p>
    <h2>Searching file names</h2>
    <p>
      If you include something like <code>ext:pdf</code> or <code>ext:docx</code> it restricts the results to PDF or Word files (or files that have the text as a suffix after a dot, really).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to look for a file with something in the name, you can write <code>fn:stuff</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Combining or excluding things</h2>
    <p>
      Search terms are all required to match the document by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can ask an either/or question using <code>OR</code> (uppercase is important).
      For example if you want either PDFs or word files containing the word validation, your query should be <code>validation (ext:pdf OR ext:docx)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can negate a term (require that it doesn't match) by prefixing it with a dash.
      For example if you want to find any non-csv document containing the word candlestick, your query should be <code>candlestick -ext:csv</code>
    </p>

    <h1>Links to files</h1>
    Unfortunately web browsers won't let you link to local files nowadays, do the links don't work.
